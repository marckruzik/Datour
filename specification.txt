If no entry parameter is specified, It does nothing.
If It is missing the rights to modifiy a filepath, It does nothing. 
If a file has already a date prefix, It does nothing.
If the entry parameter is a folderpath, It does nothing.
If the filepath is inexistant, It does nothing.

It populates a log for every action.
The log is created in Its current folder, in a subfolder called "log".
A new log is created if the current date changes.
The log has a filename "YYYY_MM_DD.txt", using the current date.
